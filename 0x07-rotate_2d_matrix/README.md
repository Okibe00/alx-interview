Let’s break down the process of rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise in more detail. Suppose we have an `n x n` matrix like this:

### Initial matrix:
```
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
```

Our goal is to rotate this matrix 90 degrees clockwise so it looks like this:

### Rotated matrix:
```
7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3
```

To achieve this, we perform two main operations: **transposition** and **row reversal**.

### Step 1: Transpose the matrix
Transposing a matrix means flipping it over its diagonal, so that rows become columns. In other words, the element at position `(i, j)` in the matrix gets swapped with the element at position `(j, i)`.

#### Transpose process:
1. Start at the first row (`i = 0`):
   - Swap `matrix[0][1]` with `matrix[1][0]`, resulting in:
     ```
     1  4  3
     2  5  6
     7  8  9
     ```
   - Swap `matrix[0][2]` with `matrix[2][0]`, resulting in:
     ```
     1  4  7
     2  5  6
     3  8  9
     ```

2. Move to the second row (`i = 1`):
   - Swap `matrix[1][2]` with `matrix[2][1]`, resulting in:
     ```
     1  4  7
     2  5  8
     3  6  9
     ```

After this step, we have successfully transposed the matrix:
```
1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9
```

### Step 2: Reverse each row
Next, to rotate the matrix clockwise, we reverse each row. This means we swap the first and last elements in each row.

#### Row reversal process:
1. For the first row, reverse `[1, 4, 7]` to get `[7, 4, 1]`.
2. For the second row, reverse `[2, 5, 8]` to get `[8, 5, 2]`.
3. For the third row, reverse `[3, 6, 9]` to get `[9, 6, 3]`.

After reversing all rows, we get the final matrix:
```
7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3
```

This is the 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original matrix.

### Code Explanation:
Let’s revisit the code and add more detailed comments:

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)  # Get the size of the matrix (n x n)

    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    # We only swap elements in the upper triangle (i < j) to avoid swapping twice
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):  # Start at j = i to skip elements below the diagonal
            # Swap element at [i][j] with element at [j][i]
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        # Reverse the ith row
        matrix[i].reverse()
```

### Key concepts:
1. **Transpose**:
   - This operation essentially swaps rows with columns, which is a crucial step in converting the matrix into its rotated form.
   - Instead of swapping all elements, we only swap the upper triangle (elements above the diagonal) to avoid double swapping.

2. **Row reversal**:
   - After transposing, the rows need to be reversed to complete the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
   - This reversal ensures that the transposed columns (which were previously rows) are arranged in the correct order.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the initial matrix:

```
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

1. After transposing:
   ```
   [
     [1, 4, 7],
     [2, 5, 8],
     [3, 6, 9]
   ]
   ```

2. After reversing each row:
   ```
   [
     [7, 4, 1],
     [8, 5, 2],
     [9, 6, 3]
   ]
   ```

This gives us the final matrix after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.

### Why This Works:
The reason this two-step process works is based on matrix properties:
- Transposition moves the elements to their new positions for the rotation, but they are in reverse order.
- Reversing the rows corrects this order, thus completing the rotation.

By performing these two operations, we achieve an in-place 90-degree clockwise rotation of the matrix!
The time complexity of the solution to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise can be broken down into two steps:

1. **Transpose the matrix**: This step involves iterating over each element above the diagonal and swapping it with its corresponding element across the diagonal. The number of such swaps is equal to the number of elements in the upper triangle of the matrix.

   - There are `n` rows, and for each row `i`, we swap elements from `i + 1` to `n - 1`, which means for row 0, we swap `n - 1` elements, for row 1, we swap `n - 2` elements, and so on.
   - The total number of swaps is:
     \[
     \text{Number of swaps} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
     \]
   - This gives a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) for the transpose step.

2. **Reverse each row**: After transposing, we need to reverse each row of the matrix. Reversing a row of size `n` takes \( O(n) \), and since there are `n` rows, the total time complexity for this step is \( O(n^2) \).

### Overall time complexity:
Both the transposing and reversing steps have a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is:

\[
O(n^2)
\]

### Space complexity:
The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because we perform all operations in-place, without requiring any additional space that scales with the input size. We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables during the swaps.
